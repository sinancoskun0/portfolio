A small portfolio project to gain hands-on experience with common IT consulting tools. Not a real engagement — just a realistic scenario with mock data.

## Scenario

Analyzing a "bug report to deployment" workflow: identifying inefficiencies, designing an optimized future state, and building an implementation roadmap.

## Contents

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `as-is-process.bpmn` | Current state process model with pain points annotated |
| `to-be-process.bpmn` | Optimized process model with improvements |
| `confluence-export.pdf` | Project documentation (charter, stakeholder analysis, recommendations) |
| `kpi-dashboard.pdf` | PowerBI dashboard showing before/after metrics |

## Tools Practiced

- **Camunda Modeler** — BPMN process modeling
- **Atlassian Confluence** — Documentation and project structure
- **Atlassian Jira** — Roadmap and backlog management
- **PowerBI** — KPI visualization with DAX measures
