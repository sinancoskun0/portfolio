Basic Prompt: Create a 3D text helix visualizer in a single HTML file. The user inputs text and the characters spiral around a rotating double helix shape. Make it interactive with mouse controls.

Engineered Prompt: Create a 3D text helix visualizer in a single HTML file using Three.js (import from CDN). 
Requirements: Structure: 
- Two intertwined helical strands (like DNA) 
- User's input text splits: odd characters on strand A, even on strand B 
- Each character is a 3D text sprite positioned along the helix 
- Helix has 3 full rotations over its height 
- Helix auto-rotates slowly on Y axis Input: 
- Text input field at top of screen 
- Updates helix in real-time as user types 
- Default text: "HELLO WORLD" Interaction: 
- Mouse drag: rotate helix manually (OrbitControls) 
- Scroll: zoom in/out 
- Slider: helix rotation speed (0 to 2, default 0.5) 
- Slider: helix radius (50 to 200, default 100) 
- Color pickers: strand A color, strand B color Visual: 
- Dark background (#0a0a0a) 
- Characters are white, 14px, face camera (billboarded) 
- Thin lines connecting characters along each strand 
- Soft ambient light + directional light from above 
- Canvas fills viewport, responsive resize Code: Use ES6 modules, clean structure, comments on key sections.
